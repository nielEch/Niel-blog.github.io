        SAN ROQUE PARISH CHURCH is a history of cordova it is build way back 1863 it is known as the roman catholic church .The San Roque Parish in the town of Cordova stands out because of its Moorish-influenced design with two majestic columns on each side of the facade. 


        The church is located at the town center,
        But before the structure that you now see was built, the residents of the town built a rickety structure made of stones, wood harigues or tabique pampango and a roof of nipa palm, church records said. It was built under Fr. Jose Salazar, the first parish priest. On May 22, 1863, the Cordoba Parish was presented to the Cebu District and was designated San Roque Parish of Cordoba, proclaiming Sr. San Roque as the patron saint.
        
        We should go church every sunday to save our each soul, or lets just say you're too busy to go to church, atleast pray it will good for you.
